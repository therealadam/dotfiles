# Dotfiles mk2: an exosuit

With a fresh, or even a janky, laptop:

```
cd; mkdir setup
curl .../mac > mac
git clone thoughtbot/dotfiles and therealadam/powersuit
rcup
```
1. Clone [dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles) and this repo
2. Bootstrap via [laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop)
3. Run `mac` again to pick up local customizations that are now symlinked
4. Run keyboard setup: TBD

## TODO

- a tasteful, but not overboard macOS setup
- keyboard/Karabiner/Hammerspoon setup
- atom package syncing
